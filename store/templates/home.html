            </h2>
            <pre>
        Sun protection is an important aspect of skin care. 
        Though the sun is beneficial in order for the human body to get its
        daily dose of vitamin D,
        unprotected excessive sunlight can cause extreme damage to
        the skin. Ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) radiation in the sun's rays can 
        cause sunburn in varying degrees,
        early ageing and an increased risk of skin cancer.
          
        Natural skin care uses topical creams and lotions made of ingredients
        available in nature.Much of the recent literature reviews plant-derived
        ingredients, which may include herbs,
        roots, flowers and essential oils, but natural substances
        in skin care products.

                <h1 class="featurette-heading">  Panchkarma <span class="text-muted"></span></h1>
        Panchakarma is a method of cleansing the body of all
        the unwanted waste after lubricating it.
        Panchakarma are 5 (five) in number; hence the term
        PANCHA (five) KARMA (procedures). Panchakarma treatment is
        unique in the sense that it includes preventive, curative
        and promotive actions for various diseases.
        Ayurveda has rightly emphasized that health is not only the state
        of not having disease but, it is the state of normalcy of Dosha, Dathu,
        Agni and Malakriya. It also includes the Prasanna Atma (soul), Indriya
        (sense organs) and Manas (mind).

        Three doshas of the body, Vata, Pitta and Kapha, which broadly represent
        the nervous system, the metabolic system and the nutritive system, keep 
        the human body in balance. Whenever the delicate balance between these 
        doshas is disturbed, a disease may be manifested. The main objective of
        the Ayurvedic system of treatment is to restore the original state of 
        equilibrium between the doshas. In order to achieve the same Ayurveda 
        has advocated certain regimens and treatment modalities such as Dinacharya,
        Rutucharya, Vega Adharana, Rasayanaâ€“Vajikarana and Panchakarma.
